This repo contains a collection of FIJI macros, see below for specifics.

**1_commonTools**  
These are commonly used (by me) macros for routine processing of confocal time series.

**2_batchProcessing**  
Macros or batch processing large datasets. Many of these toosl are unpolished and not broadly useful, but this remains of public repository so that my current and future labmates can recycle the helpful ones.

**3_uncommonTools**  
These are neither broadly useful or geared towards batch analysis, but this remains of public repository so that my current and future labmates can recycle the helpful ones.

**Moe et al 2021**  
These macros were published as part of the manuscript [Cross-talk-dependent cortical patterning of Rho GTPases during cell repair](https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/full/10.1091/mbc.E20-07-0481)
